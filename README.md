# hexpacker

A hexagonal circle packing implementation for canvasing/sampling large geographical areas (specifically optimized for Google/Instagram/Twitter APIs)

## Installation

    $ git clone git@github.com:shayanjm/hexpacker.git

## Usage

#### To play:

    $ lein repl

#### To work:

    $ lein uberjar
    $ java -jar hexpacker-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]


## Examples

If you wanted to generate the collection of packed circles bounded by a large radius of 3KM, and smaller radii of 50 meters:

```clojure
(ns hexpacker.stitch)
(def center-point {:lat 30.268147 :lng -97.743926})
(def packed-circle-coords (pack-geo-circle center-point 3000 50))
(count packed-circle-coords)
;=> 2791
```
This repo hasn't been "library-ized" just yet, but I may spin out the mercator, haversine, and stitching components into separate modules.


## Calling hexpacker from your code

Since this repo is an implementation (as opposed to a library), you will have to load/include the appropriate namespaces manually.

+ `hexpacker.stitch` contains all of the code pertaining to circle packing/coordinate generation. Incanter is also included in this namespace in case you want to run some tests via plotting.

+ `hexpacker.mercator` contains the mercator projection definitions (keep in mind that there are some artifacts in the file for niceness when plotting with incanter)

+ `hexpacker.haversine` contains the haversine (and reverse-haversine) implementations.

Realistically, you should only need to load hexpacker.stitch/pack-geo-circle function if you just want to generate circle packings.
### Notes

+ 

+ Using spherical approximation of earth (versus spheroid) because it's a simpler model. It introduces some error, but who cares?

+ Consistent with the same assumptions used by most consumer-level GIS services (i.e: Google).

+ Using mercator projection to overlay 2D mesh (circle packing) onto 3D surface (Earth)
+ Distance from point < 15m = match.
