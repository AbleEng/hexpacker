### Notes

+ Using spherical approximation of earth (versus spheroid) because it's a simpler model. It introduces some error, but who cares?

+ Consistent with the same assumptions used by most consumer-level GIS services (i.e: Google).

+ Using mercator projection to overlay 2D mesh (circle packing) onto 3D surface (Earth)
+ Distance from point < 15m = match.
